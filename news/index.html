<body> <p>Spanning nearly 32,000 square miles, Lake Superior is not only the largest freshwater lake in the world (by surface area) but it is also one of the largest lakes in the world, second only to the Caspian Sea. In fact, if you were to add up all the water in Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Ontario, and four of Lake Erie it would total the volume of Lake Superior.
Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, as well as many other protected dunes along the western coast of Michigan, make up the worldâ€™s largest collection of freshwater sand dunes. The tallest dune at Sleeping Bear stands about 450 feet above the shore of Lake Michigan.</p>
